This is a legacy repo as it uses the old theme, however it is useful for keeping track of how the theme is doing, and will be updated with any fixes

# Old Portfolio Website

This is the content of my personal website hosted at [samrobbins.uk](https://old.samrobbins.uk). The theme which I have made is stored in a separate github repository [hugo-developer-portfolio](https://github.com/samrobbins85/hugo-developer-portfolio).
